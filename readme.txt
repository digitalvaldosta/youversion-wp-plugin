== Description ==

Instructions on How To Use the [youversion] Tags

The YouVersion Wordpress plugin gives you the ability to quickly link to Bible verses using a simple tag structure that's familiar to Wordpress.

First, make sure to choose the Bible version you want all links to use. You can change this setting using the drop down list above.

Second, when you create a new post or page on your Wordpress powered website, use this format [youversion]PLAIN TEXT REFERENCE[/youversion] to create a reference with a link to that verse on YouVersion.

Example:

In the text editor, type: "Hi, my name is Scott and [youversion]John 3:16[/youversion] is my favorite verse."
When you publish the post or page, it will look like: "Hi, my name is Scott and John 3:16 is my favorite verse."
Remember to spell the verse reference properly and use the commonly accepted format for Bible references (ie. John 3:16). The reference formats that work are "John 3:16" and "John 3:16-18".

References that use commas (ie. John 3:16,18) or multi-chapter spans (ie. John 3:16-4:5) will not work and will result in a link that leads to a dead page on YouVersion.com.
